# huk_challenge
This is the repo for a coding challenge provided by HUK-Coburg.

The task can be found [here](Coding_Challenge_NLP.pdf)

The solution for the task is provided in a [rendered notebook](/huk_challenge/main.ipynb)

You do not have to run the notebook, nevertheless below you find a manual for installation.

## Requirements

* Ubuntu >=18.04
* Python >= 3.9.6

## Instructions


1. Create a new Python Environment with `python -m venv <environment-name>` and activate it wiht `source <environment-name>/bin/activate`.
2. Install package with `pip install -e .`, when in the root directory of the repository.
3. Execute `huk_challenge/main.ipynb` if necessary. All results were obtained from this file. The jupyter-notebook will need approximately 4 minutes to finish, when executed on a decent laptop.
